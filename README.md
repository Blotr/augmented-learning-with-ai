Notes, settings, and prompts for learning software development using AI

---

I am currently a software development apprentice, alternating between school and my workplace in a roughly 20/80 split.

In both environments, AI has been an integral part of my workflow from the beginning and not always in a good way. At work, the use of AI tools is actively encouraged to improve productivity. In school, however, there is no coherent policy or shared approach. Some educators are critical and avoid AI altogether, while others are more positive and encourage its use.

This repository is my attempt to navigate that and design a workflow that prioritizes learning and understanding over mindless productivity.

## Main

AI should mainly support and augment learning, not entirely replace it.  
This repository focuses on using AI as a mentor and thinking partner, not as a shortcut to finished solutions.
